# ClaudeC99 Floating-Point Implementation Plan — Stages 109–112

_Drafted 2026-06-13 — Stage 109 completed 2026-06-13 — Stage 110 completed 2026-06-13_

## Overview

Floating-point support (`float` and `double`) is the largest remaining
language gap in ClaudeC99. It touches every compiler layer — the lexer,
the type system, the parser, and the code generator — and requires
following the SysV AMD64 ABI's SSE2 calling convention. The work is
split into four independent, shippable stages so that each stage can be
self-hosted and tested before the next begins.

`long double` (x87 80-bit) is explicitly deferred; its stack semantics
are significantly different from SSE2 and the practical benefit is low.

## Stage 109 — Types, Literals, and Stack Variables ✓ COMPLETED

**Spec**: `docs/stages/ClaudeC99-spec-stage-109-float-double-types-literals.md`
**Milestone**: `docs/milestones/stage-109-milestone.md`
**Status**: Complete — 1627/1627 tests pass; C0→C1→C2 self-host verified.

**Scope**: everything needed to declare and load/store float/double values;
no arithmetic, no comparisons, no function calls.

- **Lexer**: `TOKEN_FLOAT`, `TOKEN_DOUBLE`; float/double literal lexing
  (decimal `1.5`, `.5`, `1.0e-3`; suffixes `f`/`F` for float, no suffix
  for double).
- **AST**: new node `AST_FLOAT_LITERAL` carrying the raw literal text.
- **Type system**: `TYPE_FLOAT`, `TYPE_DOUBLE` added to `include/type.h` /
  `src/type.c`; `sizeof(float) == 4`, `sizeof(double) == 8`.
- **Parser**: `float`/`double` in `parse_type_specifier`; float literals
  in `parse_primary`.
- **Codegen**:
  - Stack frame: 4-byte slots for `float` (4-byte aligned), 8-byte slots
    for `double` (8-byte aligned).
  - FP expression results land in `xmm0` (analogous to `rax` for integers).
  - Load: `movss xmm0, [rbp - N]` / `movsd xmm0, [rbp - N]`.
  - Store: `movss [rbp - N], xmm0` / `movsd [rbp - N], xmm0`.
  - Float literals: emitted to `.rodata` as `DD` (float) / `DQ` (double)
    with a generated label; referenced via `movss xmm0, [rel Lfc_N]`.
- **No** arithmetic, comparisons, or function calls with FP operands yet.

**Deliverable**: `float x = 1.5f; double y = x;` compiles and runs. ✓

**Implementation notes** (actual vs. plan):
- Deduplication key is the **raw literal text** (including `f`/`F` suffix),
  not the numeric value — "1.5f" and "1.5" are distinct pool entries with
  separate labels. This correctly handles `float` vs `double` at the NASM
  level (`DD` vs `DQ`).
- The `FpLiteral` pool struct carries an `is_double` flag in addition to
  `raw_text` and `label`; the `codegen_intern_fp_literal()` function takes
  a `TypeKind` parameter rather than inferring from the suffix.
- File-scope FP initializers needed a dedicated branch in
  `parse_external_declaration` because the existing `eval_const_expr` path
  for non-pointer scalars cannot handle `AST_FLOAT_LITERAL` nodes. The
  branch accepts only `AST_FLOAT_LITERAL` as a valid FP global initializer.
- NASM strips the `f`/`F` suffix itself but ClaudeC99 strips it manually
  before emission to be safe and explicit.
- Labels use `Lfc<N>` (not `Lfc_N` as the spec suggested); the plan's
  underscore form was a minor inconsistency.

## Stage 110 — FP Arithmetic, Conversions, and Casts ✓ COMPLETED

**Spec**: `docs/stages/ClaudeC99-spec-stage-110-float-double-arithmetic.md`
**Milestone**: `docs/milestones/stage-110-milestone.md`
**Status**: Complete — 1635/1635 tests pass; C0→C1→C2 self-host verified.

**Scope**: expressions involving float/double operands; implicit and
explicit conversions between integer and FP types.

- **Codegen — binary arithmetic** (left in `xmm0`, right in `xmm1`,
  result in `xmm0`):
  - `addss`/`addsd`, `subss`/`subsd`, `mulss`/`mulsd`, `divss`/`divsd`.
  - Binary op evaluation: push `xmm0` to stack (`sub rsp, 8` +
    `movsd [rsp], xmm0`) before evaluating the right operand into `xmm0`;
    pop into `xmm1` (`movsd xmm1, [rsp]` + `add rsp, 8`); then emit op.
- **Unary minus**: `xorpd xmm0, [rel Lsign_mask_f64]` (sign-bit mask in
  `.rodata`); `float` uses `xorps`.
- **Usual Arithmetic Conversions for FP** (C99 §6.3.1.8):
  `int op float → float`, `float op double → double`,
  `int op double → double`.
- **Implicit conversions**:
  - int → float: `cvtsi2ss xmm0, rax`
  - int → double: `cvtsi2sd xmm0, rax`
  - float → double: `cvtss2sd xmm0, xmm0`
  - double → float: `cvtsd2ss xmm0, xmm0`
- **Explicit casts** (`(float)`, `(double)`, `(int)` on FP values):
  - FP → int: `cvttss2si rax, xmm0` / `cvttsd2si rax, xmm0` (truncating).
- **`sizeof(float)` = 4, `sizeof(double)` = 8** (already from Stage 109).

**Deliverable**: `double d = (double)n / 3.0; float f = (float)d + 1.5f;`
compiles and produces correct results. ✓

**Implementation notes** (actual vs. plan):
- **`expr_result_type` bug** (not anticipated): the type-inference helper
  used size-based fallback for `AST_VAR_REF` locals and globals, returning
  `TYPE_INT` for 4-byte floats and `TYPE_LONG` for 8-byte doubles. Without
  fixing this, `type_is_fp()` was always false and the FP arithmetic path
  was never entered — all FP binary ops fell through to integer codegen. Fix:
  added `type_is_fp(lv->kind)` guards for local and global var-ref paths in
  `expr_result_type`, plus `AST_FLOAT_LITERAL` handling and FP-first UAC
  checks in `AST_BINARY_OP`/`AST_UNARY_OP`. The same fixes applied to
  `sizeof_type_of_expr`.
- **Operand order after save/restore**: after the left-operand save/right-
  operand eval/left-restore sequence, `xmm0` holds the right operand and
  `xmm1` holds the left. For commutative ops (`+`, `*`) the op is emitted
  directly (`addsd xmm0, xmm1`); for non-commutative ops the result must be
  moved: `subsd xmm1, xmm0` then `movsd xmm0, xmm1` (analogously for
  division). The plan described the final state as "left in `xmm0`, right in
  `xmm1`" but the actual post-restore state is inverted.
- **Sign-mask alignment** (bug found during implementation): `xorps`/`xorpd`
  read 16 bytes and require 16-byte-aligned operands. Initial emission placed
  the 4-byte `DD 0x80000000` mask immediately after an arbitrary-sized
  `.rodata` entry, causing a General Protection Fault (SIGSEGV). Fixed by
  emitting `align 16` before each mask and padding to the full 16 bytes:
  `Lfp_smask_f32: dd 0x80000000, 0, 0, 0` (float) and
  `Lfp_smask_f64: dq 0x8000000000000000, 0` (double).
- **Sign-mask label names**: `Lfp_smask_f32` and `Lfp_smask_f64` (the plan
  wrote `Lsign_mask_f64`; the actual names include the `fp_` prefix and the
  `_f32`/`_f64` suffix to distinguish float from double).
- **Sign masks emitted on demand**: two new `CodeGen` flags
  (`fp_sign_mask_f32_emitted`, `fp_sign_mask_f64_emitted`) are set the first
  time each mask is needed; `codegen_emit_fp_literals` emits only the masks
  actually used.
- **`fp_common_arith_kind` helper** added to `src/codegen.c` alongside the
  existing `common_arith_kind` to implement FP UAC: double wins over float
  wins over any integer kind.

## Stage 111 — FP Comparisons and Boolean Contexts ✓ COMPLETED

**Spec**: `docs/stages/ClaudeC99-spec-stage-111-float-double-comparisons.md`
**Milestone**: `docs/milestones/stage-111-milestone.md`
**Status**: Complete — 1643/1643 tests pass; C0→C1→C2 self-host verified.

**Scope**: using float/double in comparison expressions and control-flow
conditions.

- **Instruction**: `ucomiss xmm0, xmm1` (float) / `ucomisd xmm0, xmm1`
  (double). Sets CF, ZF, PF (PF = 1 for unordered/NaN).
- **Comparison operators** — load left into `xmm0`, right into `xmm1`,
  then emit `ucomiss`/`ucomisd` and set `al` via:

  | Op  | Condition code(s) | Notes |
  |-----|-------------------|-------|
  | `<` | `setb al`         | CF=1 |
  | `<=`| `setbe al`        | CF=1 or ZF=1 |
  | `>` | `seta al`         | CF=0 and ZF=0 |
  | `>=`| `setae al`        | CF=0 |
  | `==`| `sete al; setnp cl; and al, cl` | equal AND not unordered |
  | `!=`| `setne al; setp cl; or al, cl`  | not-equal OR unordered |

- **Boolean context** (`if`, `while`, `for`, `?:` condition on FP value):
  `xorpd xmm1, xmm1` (zero); `ucomisd xmm0, xmm1`; `setne al; setp cl;
  or al, cl`; `movzx rax, al`.
- **Logical `!` on FP**: via helper function `emit_fp_bool_to_rax` for condition test, not "xor al, 1".

**Deliverable**: FP comparisons and control-flow work; bubble-sort over
a `double[]` compiles and produces correct results. ✓

**Implementation notes** (actual vs. plan):
- **Helper function placement**: `emit_fp_bool_to_rax()` was initially placed
  at the end of `src/codegen.c`, but it is called inside `codegen_expression()`
  which appears earlier in the file. This triggered a C99 implicit-declaration
  error during bootstrap. Fix: moved the function to the FP helper section
  immediately after `emit_fp_widen_if_needed`.
- **Operand order after save/restore**: following Stage 110's convention, left
  is saved to stack, right is evaluated into xmm0, left is restored to xmm1.
  After restore, `xmm1 = left`, `xmm0 = right`; the instruction is thus
  `ucomisd xmm1, xmm0` (left cmp right).
- **Logical NOT on FP**: spec used `sete al; setnp cl; and al, cl` (from
  `emit_fp_bool_to_rax`), not the plan's "xor al, 1" variant. Both are
  semantically equivalent for normal values, but the spec version correctly
  gives `!NaN = 0` (the XOR variant would give 1, which is incorrect per C99).
- **Condition handling**: both `emit_cond_cmp_zero()` and `AST_CONDITIONAL_EXPR`
  were updated to detect FP condition types and call `emit_fp_bool_to_rax()`
  before the existing integer condition test.

## Stage 112 — FP Calling Convention, `va_arg`, and `<math.h>` ✓ COMPLETED

**Spec**: `docs/stages/ClaudeC99-spec-stage-112-float-double-calls-math.md`
**Milestone**: `docs/milestones/stage-112-milestone.md`
**Status**: Complete — 1650/1650 tests pass; C0→C1→C2 self-host verified.

**Scope**: calling functions with FP arguments; returning FP values;
variadic calls with FP arguments; `va_arg` for `double`; `<math.h>` stub.

### Non-variadic calls
- SysV AMD64: FP args go in `xmm0`–`xmm7` (tracked independently from
  integer arg slots in `rdi`–`r9`).
- Call-site: extend the argument-classification loop with a parallel
  `xmm_arg_count` counter; emit FP args as `movsd [rsp + N], xmm0` or
  directly into `xmm0`–`xmm7`.
- Prologue: FP parameters read from `xmm0`–`xmm7` into local stack slots
  at function entry.
- FP return value arrives in `xmm0`; caller moves it to the local stack
  slot as needed.

### Variadic calls
- `al` must contain the count of `xmm` registers used before each `call`
  to a variadic function.
- Extend call-site codegen to track `xmm_arg_count` and emit `mov al,
  <count>` before the `call`.

### `va_arg` for `double`
- C99 §6.5.2.2p6: `float` arguments are promoted to `double` in variadic
  calls — callers always pass `double`.
- Extend the variadic function prologue to save `xmm0`–`xmm7` into the
  register-save area (16 bytes each, starting at `reg_save_area + 48`).
- `va_arg(ap, double)`: read `ap->fp_offset`; if `< 176` (48 + 8×16),
  load from `reg_save_area + fp_offset`, advance `fp_offset += 16`;
  otherwise load from `overflow_arg_area` and advance it.
- `va_arg(ap, float)` is undefined by C99 (float is always promoted);
  ClaudeC99 may error or treat it as `double`.

### `test/include/math.h` stub
Single-precision and double-precision declarations for:
`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `sinh`, `cosh`,
`tanh`, `exp`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `cbrt`, `fabs`,
`fabsf`, `floor`, `floorf`, `ceil`, `ceilf`, `round`, `roundf`, `fmod`,
`fmodf`, `fmin`, `fmax`, `fminf`, `fmaxf`, `isnan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`.
The `float` variants use the `f` suffix.

**Deliverable**: `printf("%.2f\n", sqrt(2.0))` compiles and prints `1.41`. ✓

**Implementation notes** (actual vs. plan):
- **`movaps` alignment bug** (found during bootstrap): The initial rso=184 placed
  the xmm0 save slot at [rbp-136]. With rbp mod 16=0 (true for all functions: `call`
  + `push rbp` = 16 bytes, restoring alignment), [rbp-136] mod 16=8 — not aligned for
  `movaps`. Fixed: rso=176 (exact 48+128, no padding), xmm0 slot at [rbp-128] (0 mod 16).
- **`compute_call_layout` decl_type bug** (found during testing): Variadic extra args
  use `call_node->children[i]->decl_type` which is 0 (TYPE_VOID) for expression nodes
  like `AST_VAR_REF`. So `printf("%f", d)` classified `d` as a GP arg, not XMM, and
  printed `0`. Fixed: new `const TypeKind *actual_types` parameter computed from
  `expr_result_type` at each call site.
- **Array dimension arithmetic** (found during bootstrap): ClaudeC99 does not support
  arithmetic expressions in local array size declarations. `[MAX_CALL_LAYOUT_ITEMS + 2]`
  caused a parse error. Fixed: replaced with literal `[26]` (= 24 + 2).
- **`test/valid/run_tests.sh` `.libs` support**: Math tests (`sqrt`, `pow`) require
  `-lm`. Added `.libs` companion file mechanism (matching integration runner) so tests
  can specify extra link flags. On glibc 2.39, sqrt/pow are in libm.so.6 not libc.so.6
  when linking raw .o files.
- **`HUGE_VAL`/`INFINITY`/`NAN` omitted**: The spec's stub included these as
  `__builtin_*()` calls. ClaudeC99 does not support `__builtin_*` builtins; these
  three macros were omitted from `test/include/math.h`.

---

## Key design decisions across all four stages

### FP result register convention
Integer/pointer expression results land in `rax`; FP results land in
`xmm0`. The codegen tracks the result type of each expression and emits
the appropriate move/store. Binary operator codegen saves `xmm0` to the
stack (via `sub rsp, 8` + `movsd [rsp], xmm0`) when it needs to preserve
the left-hand side while evaluating the right-hand side — analogous to
the existing `push rax` / `pop rcx` pattern for integer binary ops.

### Float literals in `.rodata`
NASM accepts bare decimal values after `DD` and `DQ` directives
(`DD 1.5` emits a 4-byte IEEE 754 float; `DQ 1.5` emits an 8-byte
double). Literals are deduplicated by value using a flat table per
translation unit; each emits a label `Lfc_N` in `.rodata` and is
referenced via `[rel Lfc_N]`.

### `long double` deferred
x87 80-bit extended precision uses a completely different register file
(`st0`–`st7`) and stack-based operations. It is out of scope for all four
stages.

### Interaction with self-hosting
Stages 109–112 should each pass the full self-host C0→C1→C2 cycle before
the next stage begins. The compiler source (`src/*.c`) uses no
floating-point itself, so the self-host cycle remains clean throughout.
