# Full Grammar Parse Tree — Stage 108

Complete hierarchy of parser functions, grouped into four sections. Each level
calls the level(s) below it for sub-constructs. Indentation tracks call depth;
`└─►` indicates the primary descent path, `├─►` indicates a branch.

Diagnostics are raised through the `PARSER_ERROR(parser, …)` macro, which calls
`compile_error_at` with the current token's `file:line:col` position (stage
70-02/70-03). Under `--max-errors=N` the parser recovers via setjmp/longjmp and
`parser_sync()` to the next declaration boundary instead of exiting on the first
error (stage 70-01).

Since stage-75-06 the parser has closed every self-compilation gap:
`for`-init declarations (76), constant-expression `case` labels (77), general
postfix chaining (78), general-lvalue compound assignment (79) and `++`/`--`
(80), `const`/`volatile` qualifiers in member and type-name contexts (82),
multidimensional arrays (86), adjacent string concatenation (89), address-of
on member lvalues (91), and struct/union by-value parameters and returns (91-01).
Stage 92 converted `ASTNode.children` from a fixed 64-slot array into a
lazily-allocated doubling dynamic array (large translation units, blocks, and
switches were silently truncated before), which finally let the full `src/`
tree bootstrap. **As of stage 92 the compiler is fully self-hosting:** C0
(gcc-built) compiles itself to C1, and C1 compiles itself to C2, with all 1479
tests passing at each step (see `docs/self-compilation-report.md`).

**Stages 91-01 through 95-12 carry no expression-grammar or AST-shape changes.**
Stage 91-01 (struct-by-value) and stage 93/94 (build workflow / self-host cycle)
are codegen/ABI/tooling work, and the entire 95-xx series is an internal
storage refactor: stages 95-02/95-03 add the reusable `Vec` and `StrBuf`
dynamic containers; stages 95-04 through 95-07 replace the parser/codegen
fixed-capacity tables (`enum_tags`, `union_tags`, `globals`, `enum_consts`,
`struct_tags`, `typedefs`, `funcs`, `locals`, `string_pool`, `break_stack`,
`switch_stack`, struct-field scratch, `local_statics`) with `Vec`, removing
their hard caps; and stages 95-08 through 95-11 move all token, AST, parser,
and codegen name/tag/label text from `char[MAX_NAME_LEN]` buffers into
`const char *` pointers backed by a lexer-owned string pool — which removes the
old 255-byte string-literal cap entirely. Stage 95-12 closes the last two
fixed-capacity items: the preprocessor `#if` unary-operator buffer becomes a
`StrBuf` (removing the final unbounded fixed-capacity write) and the per-switch
case/default label table inside `SwitchCtx` becomes a `Vec` (removing the
`MAX_SWITCH_LABELS` cap).

**Stage 96 is a driver/lifecycle stage — no expression-grammar, parser function,
or AST node changes.** The following new lifecycle functions are added:

- `parser_free(Parser *)` (`src/parser.c`) — `vec_free`s the seven Vecs the
  parser owns (`funcs`, `globals`, `typedefs`, `enum_consts`, `enum_tags`,
  `struct_tags`, `union_tags`); element strings remain in lexer-owned storage.
- `codegen_free(CodeGen *)` (`src/codegen.c`) — frees all codegen-generated
  strings (via the new `Vec owned_strings` field and `codegen_intern()` helper)
  then `vec_free`s all eight Vecs in `CodeGen`.
- `reset_error_state()` (`src/util.c`) — zeroes `g_error_count`,
  `g_error_src_file/line/col`, and `g_error_jmp_valid` between files.

The driver (`src/compiler.c`) now accepts one or more positional source files,
calls `reset_error_state()` + `compile_one_file()` for each, and accumulates
the overall exit status; per-file teardown (parser_free / codegen_free /
lexer_free / ast_free / free(preprocessed)) ensures each file starts from a
clean slate. None of this changes which programs parse or how they are
represented in the AST.

**Stage 97 adds `AST_DESIGNATED_INIT` and `parse_initializer_element` — the
first brace-initializer grammar change since stage 32/43/44.** Two changes:

1. **New AST node `AST_DESIGNATED_INIT`** (`include/ast.h`): holds a designator
   + initializer value pair inside an `AST_INITIALIZER_LIST`. `node->value != NULL`
   → member designator (field name); `node->value == NULL` → array index
   designator (index stored as int in `node->byte_length`). `child_count` is
   always 1 (the value initializer, produced by `parse_initializer`).

2. **New helper `parse_initializer_element`** (`src/parser.c`): detects a
   leading `.` (member designator) or `[` (array index designator) before
   delegating to `parse_initializer`. Rejects chained designators (`.a.b`,
   `.arr[0]`) with "chained designators not yet supported". Array indices are
   evaluated by `eval_case_const_expr` (forward-declared before
   `parse_initializer` so it is visible here). `parse_initializer`'s brace-list
   loop now calls `parse_initializer_element` instead of itself for each element.

Codegen changes (Tasks 3–6) update `emit_local_struct_init`,
`codegen_statement` (local array), `emit_global_struct`, and
`codegen_emit_data` (global array) to handle `AST_DESIGNATED_INIT` children.
All four use a current-position cursor that a designator can reposition; global
contexts build a `slots[]` fixed-size array map before emitting in declared order
(no VLAs — the compiler must self-host under its own pre-VLA restrictions).

**Stage 99 extends the integer constant expression evaluator and enables
`typedef enum` forward references.** No new AST node types and no new
grammar productions. Two parser changes:

1. **`eval_const_expr` replaces `eval_case_const_*`** (`src/parser.c`): the
   three-function chain `eval_case_const_primary` / `eval_case_const_unary` /
   `eval_case_const_expr` (additive only) is replaced by a nine-level
   recursive descent evaluator (`eval_const_primary`, `eval_const_unary`,
   `eval_const_multiplicative`, `eval_const_shift`, `eval_const_additive`,
   `eval_const_bitwise_and`, `eval_const_bitwise_xor`, `eval_const_bitwise_or`,
   `eval_const_expr`). New operators: `*`, `/`, `%` (division-by-zero →
   `PARSER_ERROR`); `<<`, `>>`; `&`, `^`, `|`; unary `~`, `!`; parenthesized
   sub-expressions. A `const char *context` parameter is threaded through
   the chain so error messages are specific to the call site ("case label
   expression", "enumerator value", "array designator index").

2. **`parse_enum_specifier` accepts forward-declared tags** (`src/parser.c`):
   the no-body `enum Tag` path previously errored when `Tag` was not in the
   `enum_tags` table. Now, an unknown tag creates a forward-declaration entry
   (`EnumTag { tag, is_defined=0 }`) via `vec_push` and returns `type_int()`
   immediately. This enables the idiomatic `typedef enum Status Status;`
   pattern before the body is defined. When the body is subsequently parsed
   for the same tag, the existing logic that finds the entry and sets
   `is_defined=1` completes the forward reference without further change.
   The enumerator value assignment path is updated to call
   `eval_const_expr(parser, "enumerator value")` instead of the old
   literal-only check, enabling patterns like `FLAG = 1 << 0`,
   `STEP = BASE + 5`, and `ALL = ~0`.

---

**Stage 98 adds `AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL` and the compound literal expression
grammar — `(type-name) { initializer-list }`.** Three parser changes:

1. **New AST node `AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL`** (`include/ast.h`): represents a
   C99 compound literal (§6.5.2.5). Fields: `decl_type` = base kind,
   `full_type` = struct/union/array/pointer `Type*` (NULL for plain scalars),
   `byte_length` = 0 at parse time (pre-scan overwrites with rbp-relative
   stack offset), `value` = pre-formatted type label string stored in lexer
   pool, `children[0]` = `AST_INITIALIZER_LIST` (or bare expression for
   scalar). `child_count` is always 1.

2. **`parse_cast` extended** (`src/parser.c`): after parsing `(type-name)`,
   if the next token is `TOKEN_LBRACE`, the type is a compound literal rather
   than a cast. `TOKEN_STRUCT` and `TOKEN_UNION` added to the type-start
   detection check. Compound literal is built by `build_compound_literal` and
   then `parse_postfix_suffixes` is applied, enabling `.field` / `[idx]`
   chaining. A void or function type in compound literal context → "error:
   invalid type for compound literal". An omitted-size array (`(int[])`) is
   valid for compound literals (the length is inferred from the initializer)
   but invalid for casts → "error: array type in cast has omitted size".
   `sizeof(int[])` → "error: sizeof applied to incomplete array type".

3. **`parse_postfix` extended** (`src/parser.c`): tries compound literal
   detection (`(type-name){`) before falling back to `parse_primary`. Saves
   lexer state before the `(`; if `(type-name)` is found but not followed by
   `{`, restores the saved state and falls through to `parse_primary` (which
   handles ordinary parenthesized expressions). This allows unary operators
   like `&` and `-` to directly apply to compound literals.

Additional parser helpers added:

- **`build_compound_literal(Parser *, Type *)`**: creates `AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL`
  from a parsed type and the following brace-initializer. Handles struct/union
  (delegates to `parse_initializer`), explicit-size array (delegates to
  `parse_initializer`), omitted-size array (delegates to `parse_initializer`
  then calls `infer_compound_literal_array_length`), and scalar (manually
  parses `{` assignment-expression `}`). Stores a type label in the lexer
  pool for `print_ast` display.
- **`infer_compound_literal_array_length(ASTNode *list)`**: walks the
  initializer list, tracks a cursor (repositioned by any `[N]` designator),
  and returns `max(highest designator index + 1, non-designated count)`.
- **`parse_postfix_suffixes(Parser *, ASTNode *base)`**: extracted from
  `parse_postfix`; applies any trailing `[expr]`, `.field`, `->field`,
  `(args)`, `++`, `--` suffixes to `base`. Called by both `parse_postfix`
  and `build_compound_literal` (via `parse_cast`) so compound literals
  participate in postfix chaining.

`parse_type_name` updated: `[]` (omitted first dimension at index position 0)
is now accepted in the array-suffix loop for compound literals; inner dimensions
must still be explicit.

`parse_unary` updated: the lvalue check for `&` now also accepts
`AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL` operands (compound literals are C99 lvalues).

Global initializer updated: uses `parse_assignment_expression` instead of
`parse_primary` for the non-brace path, so compound literals are fully parsed
before the constant-only check. `AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL` in that position →
"error: compound literals at file scope are not yet supported" (more specific
than the generic "non-constant initializer" message).

---

**Stage 100 adds file-scope constant-expression evaluators.** No new parser
functions, AST nodes, or grammar productions:

1. **`eval_const_primary` extended** (`src/parser.c`): now handles `TOKEN_SIZEOF`.
   `sizeof(type-name)` is now valid in constant expressions, enabling patterns
   like `static int sizes[3] = {sizeof(int), sizeof(long), sizeof(char)}`.

2. **`parse_type_specifier` extended** (`src/parser.c`): `TOKEN_ENUM` added to
   the type-start condition, so `sizeof(enum Color)` works in constant contexts.

3. **File-scope initializer path** (`src/parser.c`, `parse_external_declaration`):
   integer-typed globals now call `eval_const_expr` for initializer validation
   instead of literal-only checks, enabling patterns like
   `static int base = 1 << 4; static int mask = BASE - 1;`.

---

**Stage 101 adds block-scope static aggregate support (parser-side).** No parser
changes; codegen only:

1. **`LocalStaticVar` struct extended** (`include/codegen.h`): gains an `init_node`
   field (previously unused). Block-scope static arrays and structs can now carry
   aggregate initializers (AST_INITIALIZER_LIST children).

---

**Stage 102 extends designated-initializer support for block-scope statics.**
No parser changes; codegen array designator handling updated.

---

**Stage 103 adds `eval_const_init` for block-scope static scalar initializers.**
Codegen-side only; no parser changes. A static helper in `src/codegen.c` evaluates
constant expressions at code-generation time for block-scope static scalars,
mirroring the parser-side `eval_const_expr` with `AST_INT_LITERAL`,
`AST_CHAR_LITERAL`, `AST_SIZEOF_TYPE`, unary and binary operators.

---

**Stage 104 completes the constant-expression evaluator.** Parser-side fixes and
extensions:

1. **Fixed precedence bug** (`src/parser.c`): `eval_const_additive` and
   `eval_const_shift` had inverted call order — corrected to match C operator
   precedence (shift binds tighter than addition).

2. **Extended evaluation chain** (`src/parser.c`): the original 9-level chain
   is extended to 13 levels by adding:
   - `eval_const_relational` (< <= > >=)
   - `eval_const_equality` (== !=)
   - `eval_const_logical_and` (&&)
   - `eval_const_logical_or` (||)
   - `eval_const_conditional` (ternary ?:)

   The full chain now reads:
   ```
   eval_const_expr
     → eval_const_logical_or
       → eval_const_logical_and
         → eval_const_equality
           → eval_const_relational
             → eval_const_bitwise_or
               → eval_const_bitwise_xor
                 → eval_const_bitwise_and
                   → eval_const_additive
                     → eval_const_shift
                       → eval_const_multiplicative
                         → eval_const_unary
                           → eval_const_primary
   ```

3. **Codegen-side `eval_const_init`** extended likewise with all 13 operator levels.

---

**Stage 105 completes the C99 preprocessor.** Parser-side additions:

1. **`#pragma` directive** (`src/preprocessor.c`): `preprocess_file` recognizes
   `#pragma` directives. Unknown pragmas are silently ignored; `#pragma once`
   calls `macro_table_add_once` to mark the file as once-included.

2. **`#line` directive** (`src/preprocessor.c`): parses required digit sequence
   (line number), updates `current_line`; optionally parses a quoted filename,
   stores in `current_file_override`. `__FILE__` expansion uses
   `current_file_override` when non-NULL.

3. **Null directive** (`src/preprocessor.c`): a bare `#` followed by
   whitespace+newline is recognized and continues parsing.

4. **`_Pragma` operator** (`src/preprocessor.c`, identifier expansion):
   recognized as `_Pragma("string-literal")`. The string `"once"` triggers
   `macro_table_add_once`; anything else is silently ignored.

5. **`__func__` support** (`src/parser.c`):
   - `Parser` struct gains `current_func_name` field (after `current_func_is_variadic`).
     Set at function-definition entry; NULL when not in a function.
   - `parse_primary` extended: handles `__func__` before `__builtin_va_*`.
     Error when `current_func_name == NULL` ("used outside of a function body").
     Synthesizes an `AST_STRING_LITERAL` with the function name via
     `lexer_store_bytes(fname, len)`, setting `byte_length=len` and
     `full_type=type_array(type_char(), len+1)`.

---

**Stage 106 adds the `restrict` qualifier.** Parser-side keyword and qualifier
handling:

1. **`TOKEN_RESTRICT` added** (`include/token.h`, `src/lexer.c`): new keyword
   token after `TOKEN_VOLATILE`. Lexer maps the `"restrict"` keyword to this token.

2. **All pointer-qualifier positions consume `TOKEN_RESTRICT`** (parse-and-ignore,
   same pattern as `volatile`):
   - `parse_declarator` leading-star loop: changed from `if` to `while` over
     `TOKEN_CONST | TOKEN_VOLATILE | TOKEN_RESTRICT`
   - `parse_type_name` abstract-declarator star loop: added `TOKEN_RESTRICT`
   - `parse_declarator` fp-param-types loop: added `TOKEN_RESTRICT`
   - `parse_parameter_declaration` leading-qualifier check: added `TOKEN_RESTRICT`
   - `parse_parameter_declaration` pre-consume stars loop: added inner
     qualifier-consumption loop after each `*` to handle `restrict` between
     `*` and identifier name

3. **No semantic or codegen effect:** `restrict` has no representation in the
   Type system; it is parse-and-ignore like `volatile` at this stage.

---

**Stage 107 adds the `inline` function-specifier.** Minimal parser change and
one preprocessor fix:

1. **`TOKEN_INLINE` added** (`include/token.h`, `src/lexer.c`): new keyword token
   after `TOKEN_RESTRICT`. Lexer maps the `"inline"` keyword to this token.
   `token_type_name()` returns `"'inline'"`.

2. **`parse_declaration_specifiers` consumes `TOKEN_INLINE`** (parse-and-ignore,
   same pattern as `volatile` and `restrict`):
   - A new `else if` branch in the `while (1)` qualifier loop advances past
     `TOKEN_INLINE` and continues without setting any field in `DeclSpecResult`.
   - Position: after the `TOKEN_VOLATILE` branch and before the
     `TOKEN_EXTERN`/`TOKEN_STATIC`/`TOKEN_TYPEDEF` branch.
   - No semantic or codegen effect: `inline` is a C99 §6.7.4 function-specifier;
     ClaudeC99 never inlines functions, so parse-and-ignore is correct.
   - Unlike `restrict`, `inline` never appears after `*` inside a declarator, so
     no changes to pointer-qualifier loops are needed.

3. **Preprocessor fix: `__FILE__`/`__LINE__` in macro bodies** (`src/preprocessor.c`):
   - Two static globals `g_expand_source_path` and `g_expand_current_line` are
     added at file scope (forward-declared after `expand_macros_text`'s prototype).
   - `preprocess_internal` sets these globals immediately before each call to
     `expand_macros_text` (argument pre-expansion and body rescan) so the
     expansion of function-like macro bodies can resolve `__FILE__`/`__LINE__`
     to the invocation-site file and line.
   - `expand_macros_text` now checks for `__FILE__` (emits quoted path) and
     `__LINE__` (emits decimal integer) before the `macro_find` lookup, handling
     them before the generic identifier dispatch.
   - This fix is required for `<assert.h>`'s assert macro, which uses both
     predefined macros in its body.

4. **`AST_BUILTIN_VA_COPY` codegen** (`src/codegen.c`, codegen only; no AST or
   parser changes):
   - The combined `va_end`/`va_copy` no-op branch is split.
   - `AST_BUILTIN_VA_COPY` now emits three 8-byte register moves via `rax` to
     copy the 24-byte SysV AMD64 `va_list` struct from `src` to `dst`.
   - Both `dst` and `src` must be local variables resolved via `codegen_find_var`.

---

**Stage 108 adds `#elifdef` and `#elifndef` preprocessor directives.** Preprocessor
only — no parser, AST, or codegen changes:

1. **`#elifdef NAME` branch** (`src/preprocessor.c`): inserted immediately before
   the `#elif` branch in `preprocess_internal`'s conditional directive chain.
   - Recognized when `strncmp(s + in, "elifdef", 7) == 0` and `s[in + 7]` is
     neither alphanumeric nor `_` (keyword boundary guard).
   - Semantics: equivalent to `#elif defined(NAME)`. If the enclosing conditional
     frame has `parent_emitting && !branch_taken`, the macro table is searched for
     `NAME`; `cond_val = (macro_find(...) != NULL)`.
   - Errors: `#elifdef` without an enclosing conditional; `#elifdef` after `#else`.
   - Placed before `#elif` for consistency with the `#ifdef`-before-`#if` convention.

2. **`#elifndef NAME` branch** (`src/preprocessor.c`): inserted immediately after
   the `#elifdef` block (still before `#elif`).
   - Recognized when `strncmp(s + in, "elifndef", 8) == 0` and `s[in + 8]` is
     neither alphanumeric nor `_`.
   - Semantics: equivalent to `#elif !defined(NAME)`.
     `cond_val = (macro_find(...) == NULL)`.
   - Same error checks as `#elifdef`.

Both branches correctly update `cond_stack` state even when the surrounding block
is inactive, because they are inserted in the same pre-`emitting`-check region as
`#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif`. This is required for proper nesting.

Standardized in C23 §6.10.1; also a GCC/Clang extension accepted in C99 mode.

## Key Design Points

- Each expression level calls the level immediately below it for its operands.
  Recursion direction encodes associativity: right-recursive = right-associative,
  iterative loop = left-associative.
- `parse_expression` (comma) and `parse_assignment_expression` are the only
  right-leaning expression levels; function-call arguments use
  `parse_assignment_expression` directly, so `f(a, b)` stays two arguments.
- Parenthesized expressions and the ternary true-branch both re-enter at
  `parse_expression`, so `(a, b)` and `a ? b, c : d` are well-formed.
- **Diagnostics & recovery (stage 70):** all parser errors go through
  `PARSER_ERROR`, which attaches the current token's `file:line:col` and calls
  `compile_error_at`. With `--max-errors=N > 1` the parser uses setjmp/longjmp
  plus `parser_sync()` to resume at the next declaration boundary; the default
  (`N == 1`) exits on the first error.
- **`for`-init declarations (stage 76):** `parse_for_statement` opens a scope
  around the whole loop and lets the initializer clause be either a declaration
  or an expression; declared variables are visible in the condition, update, and
  body, and the offset bookkeeping is restored at loop exit.
- **Constant-expression `case` labels (stages 77, 99, 104):** a dedicated
  constant evaluator (`eval_const_expr`, 13-level recursive descent) folds
  integer/character literals, enum constants, and the full set of C99 compile-time
  integer operators into a single `long` value. The chain is:
  ```
  eval_const_expr → eval_const_logical_or → eval_const_logical_and
    → eval_const_equality → eval_const_relational → eval_const_bitwise_or
    → eval_const_bitwise_xor → eval_const_bitwise_and → eval_const_additive
    → eval_const_shift → eval_const_multiplicative → eval_const_unary
    → eval_const_primary
  ```
  Supports all operators: `* / % << >> + - & ^ | < <= > >= == != && || ?:`,
  unary `~ !`, and parenthesized sub-expressions. Division or modulo by zero
  → `PARSER_ERROR`. Examples: `case 1 << 2:`, `case ENUM_CONST * 2:`,
  `case x > y ? 1 : 0:` are now accepted. The same evaluator is used by
  `parse_initializer_element` for array designator indices (stage 97),
  `parse_enum_specifier` for enumerator values (stage 99), and
  `parse_external_declaration` for file-scope integer initializers (stage 100).
- **File-scope constant-expression initializers (stage 100):** file-scope
  integer-typed globals now call `eval_const_expr` for initializer validation,
  enabling patterns like `static int base = 1 << 4`.
- **`typedef enum` forward declarations (stage 99):** `parse_enum_specifier`
  now accepts an undefined `enum Tag` reference (no body) by creating a
  forward-declaration placeholder entry in `parser->enum_tags` and returning
  `type_int()`. This enables the idiomatic `typedef enum Status Status;`
  before `enum Status { OK, ERR };` pattern.
- **Block-scope static aggregates (stage 101):** block-scope `static` arrays
  and structs are now supported in codegen. The parser marks them as
  `SC_STATIC` and codegen emits them to `.bss/.data`; the `LocalStaticVar`
  struct carries an `init_node` field for aggregate initializers.
- **Designated initializers (stage 97):** `parse_initializer`'s brace-list loop
  now calls `parse_initializer_element` for each element. That helper detects
  `.IDENT =` (member designator) or `[const_expr] =` (array index designator)
  and returns an `AST_DESIGNATED_INIT` node carrying either the field name
  (in `node->value`) or the integer index (in `node->byte_length`) plus the
  value initializer as `child[0]`. Chained designators (`.a.b`, `.arr[0]`) are
  detected before the `=` is consumed and rejected with a diagnostic. Array
  indices are evaluated by `eval_const_expr` (stage 104 extension included).
  Codegen handles `AST_DESIGNATED_INIT` at four sites: local struct init
  (name lookup + cursor), local array init (two-phase zero-fill + cursor),
  global struct emit (slots[] map + declared-order emission), and global array
  emit (slots[] map + index emission). All new local arrays use fixed sizes
  (`MAX_STRUCT_FIELDS_DESIGNATED = 64`, `MAX_ARRAY_ELEMS_DESIGNATED = 1024`)
  since the compiler must self-host under its own pre-VLA restrictions.
- **Compound literals (stage 98):** `parse_cast` now detects `(type-name) {`
  and delegates to `build_compound_literal` + `parse_postfix_suffixes` instead
  of the regular cast path. `parse_postfix` also detects compound literals
  (saving/restoring lexer state) so that unary operators like `&` can apply to
  them. `build_compound_literal` handles struct/union (delegates to
  `parse_initializer`), array (with optional length inference via
  `infer_compound_literal_array_length`), and scalar (parses a braced
  assignment-expression). The `parse_type_name` abstract declarator now accepts
  `[]` as an omitted first dimension (length=0) specifically for compound
  literals. Stack slots for compound literals are pre-assigned by
  `scan_expr_compound_literals` (walks the AST before the prologue is emitted);
  the frame-size estimator `compute_compound_literal_bytes` contributes to
  `stack_size`. `AST_COMPOUND_LITERAL` at file scope → "compound literals at
  file scope are not yet supported" (still not supported).
- **C99 preprocessor (stage 105):** `#pragma once` marks the file as once-only;
  `#pragma` <unknown> is silently ignored. `#line` directive sets line numbering
  and optional file override. `_Pragma("once")` macro operator works like
  `#pragma once`. `__func__` in `parse_primary` synthesizes a read-only string
  literal for the current function name (error at file scope). Null directives
  (bare `#` + newline) are recognized and ignored.
- **`restrict` qualifier (stage 106):** the `restrict` keyword is recognized
  in all pointer-qualifier positions: leading qualifiers in declarators, per-pointer
  qualifiers (after `*`), and abstract declarators. It is parse-and-ignore with no
  semantic or codegen effect (reserved for future optimization).
- **`inline` function-specifier (stage 107):** the `inline` keyword is recognized
  in `parse_declaration_specifiers` and consumed without effect — the same
  parse-and-ignore pattern used for `volatile` and `restrict`. Unlike `restrict`,
  `inline` never appears after `*` in a declarator, so no pointer-qualifier
  loop changes are needed. No codegen effect: ClaudeC99 does not perform inlining.
- **`__FILE__`/`__LINE__` in macro bodies (stage 107):** `expand_macros_text`
  (the helper used for argument pre-expansion and rescan during function-like
  macro expansion) now handles `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` using file-scope
  static globals `g_expand_source_path` and `g_expand_current_line`, set by
  `preprocess_internal` before each call. This enables the `<assert.h>` macro
  to correctly report the invocation-site file and line number.
- **`va_copy` codegen (stage 107):** `AST_BUILTIN_VA_COPY` is no longer a
  no-op; codegen emits three 8-byte `rax` moves to copy the 24-byte SysV AMD64
  `va_list` struct from the source to the destination local variable.
- **`#elifdef`/`#elifndef` preprocessor directives (stage 108):** two new
  branch-transition directives are recognized by `preprocess_internal` in
  `src/preprocessor.c`. `#elifdef NAME` is equivalent to `#elif defined(NAME)`;
  `#elifndef NAME` is equivalent to `#elif !defined(NAME)`. Both are inserted
  before the `#elif` branch in the directive chain, consistent with the
  `#ifdef`-before-`#if` ordering. Both correctly update `cond_stack` state
  even in inactive regions (placed in the pre-`emitting`-check zone). Standardized
  in C23 §6.10.1; also accepted as a GCC/Clang extension in C99 mode.
- **General postfix chaining (stage 78):** subscript bases now include
  `AST_MEMBER_ACCESS` and `AST_ARROW_ACCESS`, and struct/union array members are
  wrapped in `TYPE_ARRAY`, enabling chains like `p->tokens[i].kind`.
- **General-lvalue assignment & `++`/`--` (stages 79/80):** compound assignment
  and prefix/postfix `++`/`--` apply to any modifiable lvalue (member access,
  subscript, deref, and chains). `ast_clone()` avoids node aliasing in the
  compound desugaring; `codegen_inc_dec_general()` handles the non-identifier
  inc/dec forms. Lvalue and const-qualification validity is enforced in codegen.
- **`!` on pointers (stage 81):** logical-not accepts pointer operands (treated
  as scalars per C99), so `if (!p)` compiles.
- **`const`/`volatile` qualifiers (stage 82):** consumed in struct/union members,
  abstract declarators, type-names (`sizeof`, casts, `va_arg`), and all
  declaration sites. `const` member writes (direct, via subscript, and through a
  pointer to a const-qualified object) are diagnosed; `volatile` is tracked with
  no codegen effect yet.
- **Function-call arity (stage 68):** the old 6-argument cap is gone. A direct
  call is validated only against the callee's signature (exact count for
  non-variadic, `>=` fixed count for variadic). 7+ arguments are handled by
  codegen via SysV AMD64 stack-passing.
- **Block-scope `static` (stage 71):** `parse_statement` accepts a leading
  `static`, parses the inner declaration, and tags the resulting
  `AST_DECLARATION` / `AST_DECL_LIST` children with `SC_STATIC`. `extern`
  remains illegal at block scope; `extern` *objects* at file scope set `is_extern`
  for `extern` directive emission (stage 84).
- **Unions (stage 72):** `parse_union_specifier` mirrors the struct path but
  places every member at offset 0 and sizes the union to its largest member.
- **Anonymous aggregates (stage 73-01):** a `struct`/`union` body with no tag
  allocates a fresh unique `Type*`; type identity is by pointer.
- **Variadic definitions & `<stdarg.h>` (stage 75):** `...` in a parameter list
  sets `is_variadic`; variadic *definitions* may leave fixed parameters unnamed.
  The four `__builtin_va_*` intrinsics are recognized in `parse_primary` before
  enum/identifier resolution; `__builtin_va_arg`'s second operand is a type-name.
- **Array-parameter decay (stages 75/86):** `parse_parameter_declaration`
  adjusts array (and array-typedef) parameter types to pointer-to-element per
  C99 §6.7.5.3p7; struct/union array members decay to pointers in value contexts
  (stage 85).
- **Multidimensional arrays (stage 86):** declarators and abstract declarators
  collect up to `MAX_ARRAY_DIMS` bracket suffixes, nested right-to-left by
  `build_array_type_from_dims`; only the first dimension may omit its size.
- **Hex/octal lexing (stages 88/90):** the lexer decodes `\xNN`/`\NNN` escapes in
  character and string literals and parses `0x`/`0X` hexadecimal integer literals
  (sharing suffix/type logic with the decimal path).
- **Adjacent string concatenation (stage 89):** `parse_primary` loops over
  consecutive `TOKEN_STRING_LITERAL` tokens, appending decoded bytes into a
  `StrBuf` and interning the result in the lexer string pool. Since stage 95-08/09
  there is no `MAX_NAME_LEN` length bound — arbitrarily long literals (and
  embedded NUL bytes) are supported, and `node->value` is a `const char *`.
- **Address-of member lvalues (stage 91):** unary `&` accepts `AST_MEMBER_ACCESS`
  and `AST_ARROW_ACCESS` operands; codegen reuses `emit_member_addr` /
  `emit_arrow_addr` and sets the result type to pointer-to-field.
- **Struct/union by value (stage 91-01):** parameters and return values follow
  the SysV AMD64 ABI — register-class (≤16 bytes) structs travel in
  `rax`/`rdx`/argument registers, memory-class (>16 bytes) structs through a
  hidden pointer. The parser attaches `full_type` to value parameters and return
  types; codegen adds `emit_struct_addr`/`emit_struct_copy` (block copy via
  `rep movsb`), `compute_struct_ret_bytes`/`claim_struct_ret_temp`, and a shared
  call-layout helper used by both call sites and prologues. Whole-struct
  assignment and decl-init from a struct rvalue (variable, call result, or copy)
  are supported.
- **Dynamic AST children (stage 92):** `ASTNode.children` is a lazily-allocated
  doubling array rather than a fixed 64-slot one. Before this, any child past
  the 64th was silently dropped — large translation units lost declarations
  (including `main`), and large blocks/switches lost statements. The `for`-node
  builder appends through `ast_add_child`.
- **Dynamic symbol tables (stages 95-04/05/06/07):** the parser and code
  generator no longer use fixed-capacity arrays for their symbol tables. The
  `Vec` container (stage 95-02) backs `enum_tags`, `union_tags`, `globals`,
  `enum_consts`, `struct_tags`, `typedefs`, and `funcs` in the parser, and
  `locals`, `globals`, `string_pool`, `break_stack`, `switch_stack`,
  `local_statics`, and `user_labels` in codegen, plus the struct/union
  field-parsing scratch buffer. Lookups/registrations use `vec_get`/`vec_push`.
  Three latent overflow bugs were fixed along the way (struct fields beyond 64
  silently dropped; unchecked `break_stack`; unguarded call-argument layout).
  Stage 95-12 finishes the series: the per-switch case/default label table in
  `SwitchCtx` becomes an embedded `Vec` of `SwitchLabel{node,label}` (init'd
  before the `SwitchCtx` is pushed, freed before it is popped, with the live
  top element re-fetched after the body so nested-switch reallocations cannot
  dangle it), and the preprocessor `#if` unary-operator run in `eval_cond_unary`
  becomes a `StrBuf` — the last unbounded fixed-capacity write in the tree.
- **Pointer-based name storage (stages 95-08/09/10/11):** identifier, tag, and
  label text is no longer copied into `char[MAX_NAME_LEN]` buffers. `Token`
  carries `const char *lexeme`/`value` with `size_t` lengths into a lexer-owned
  string pool (`lexer_store_bytes`, stage 95-08); `ASTNode.value`,
  `ParsedDeclarator.name`, every parser.h struct name/tag field, and every
  codegen name/label field are now `const char *` (stages 95-09/10/11). Names
  from AST/lexer storage are assigned by pointer; generated labels use
  `util_strdup`. The `MAX_NAME_LEN` cap no longer applies to any of them.
- **Per-file lifecycle (stage 96):** `parser_free()`, `codegen_free()`, and
  `reset_error_state()` are added to support multi-file compilation. The driver
  now accepts one or more source files; each is compiled through a fresh
  Lexer/Parser/CodeGen/AST cycle with full per-file teardown. String ownership
  in codegen is consolidated via `Vec owned_strings` and `codegen_intern()`.
  No parser functions, grammar rules, or AST node types changed.
- **Self-hosting (stages 92–108):** the compiler compiles itself. C0
  (gcc-built) produces C1, and C1 produces C2; all three pass the full
  1621-test suite, confirming bootstrap stability. The original bootstrap
  (stages 91-01/92) surfaced and fixed thirteen real defects (struct-by-value
  ABI, the silent AST-truncation bug, six struct-by-value/`sizeof` codegen bugs,
  duplicate-`extern` emission, literal/switch-label capacity limits, missing
  `global` directives, and `strtol` stubs). Stage 94 added the repeatable
  `build.sh --mode=self-host` C0→C1→C2 cycle, and the 95-xx storage-refactor
  stages each re-verified self-hosting. Stages 96 through 108 all passed
  self-hosting with no new issues. See `docs/self-compilation-report.md`.
- Typedef names are tracked in a scoped table (`scope_depth`); leaving a block
  removes typedefs registered at or below that depth.
- `parse_struct_specifier`/`parse_union_specifier` complete a forward-declaration
  placeholder in-place when a body is later provided.
- **Still parser-rejected (known gaps):** functions returning function pointers;
  pointer-to-array declarators (`(*p)[10]`); old-style (K&R) function
  definitions; chained designators (`.a.b`, `.arr[0]`); designated union init
  for non-first members; compound literals at file scope.
